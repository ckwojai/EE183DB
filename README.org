  - ALWAYS GO TO OFFICE HOURS
* Project plan
  | Milestone(s)                | Demonstration                                            |
  |-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pick our components         | Reason choosing these parts                              |
  | Hack the quadcopter         | Controll the quadcopter with Arduino code                |
  | Mathematcial Formulation    | Show our mathematical model                              |
  | Sensor Fusion               | Demonstrate angle change / vector graph                  |
  | Control circuit for motor   | Test: falling on desire side                             |
  | Develop Matlab Simulation   | Show simulation graph                                    |
  | Putting everything together | Show our modified quadcopter: video demo?                |
  | Controller Design           | Show how quadcopter reacts with different controllers    |
  | End-to-end testing          | Gather experimental results that supports our conclusion |
  | Documentation               | Document all our work                                    |
* Mathematical Derivation
  - Size of the current quadcopter
  - Start having some shit on paper so we can ask more solid question during office hours
